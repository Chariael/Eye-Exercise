Eye Exercise README

Description:
This “Eye Exercise” demonstrates coding that tracks the input of your mouse. It’s a fun example of how JavaScript can be used to make a program interactive for the user. This is a basic building block of code skill which can be used to make dynamic web-pages or entertaining games and apps.

To use this:
   Copy the repository to your local machine, then open the .html file in a browser of your choice. An image of stylized eyes should appear. Moving your mouse cursor around the screen should prompt the “pupil” of the eyes to follow it. If this doesn’t work, please double check that Index.html is located in the same folder on your computer as its .css and .js files. This html file will not work unless its friends are in the same folder.

Improvements Roadmap:
    Eventually I’d like to add a button that changes the colors of the eyes. I’d also like to add a feature where, if the cursor doesn’t move for a set amount of time, the eyes close in “sleep.” Resuming mouse motion or, perhaps, clicking the left mouse button would “wake” the eyes and resume their watchfulness.
